    Hello, I'm Ren / Prince. Welcome to my GitHub ʾʾ₍ ᐢ..ᐢ ₎  !! I don't have much to say about myself here as I wanted to use this as a guideline when it comes to Pony town. Don't worry I don't have any big rules or anything!

    I'm very friendly and always encourage interactions! I tend to be awkward though because I get anxious easily. I use Pony Town to make friends and mutuals and create fun skins and cos. Cuddles and hugs and hiding are fine with me! If I ever do something wrong then please let me know. I'm always looking to improve on myself and learn from my mistakes

    I am 17 ( I will be 18 in june ). I would like to ask that if you're below the age of 15, please keep interactions minimal ( mainly if you want to be friends ). I joke around a lot and can be a bit out of pocket. I really enjoy sonic, arcane, nights into dreams and a lot of other stuff! My favourite ships are shadilver, shadourge, knuxadow, sonjet/jet speed, caitvi, time bomb, etc !!!
