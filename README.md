    Hello, I'm Jun Seok. Welcome to my GitHub ʾʾ₍ ᐢ..ᐢ ₎  !! I don't have much to say about myself here as I wanted to use this as a guideline when it comes to Pony town. Don't worry I don't have any big rules or anything!

    I'm very friendly and always encourage interactions! I tend to be awkward though because I get anxious easily. I use Pony Town to make friends and mutuals and create fun skins and cos. Cuddles and hugs and hiding are fine with me! If I ever do something wrong then please let me know. I'm always looking to improve on myself and learn from my mistakes. English is not my first language so please be patient as i'm still learning
    </p>

    I enjoy a lot of different medias. I am not apart of any fandoms to be honest but I do like squid game, pokemon, identity v, sonic, splatoon, etc. Im always looking for more things to get into though
